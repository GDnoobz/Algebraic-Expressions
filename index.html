Recently, after years of saving up, she finally has enough money to go on a much needed vacation. Emily really does need ths vacation, as she works very hard. Althogh she does have enough money for a full featured vacation, she doesn't want to blow all her hard earned money away. Due to this, she chose to go to a place that is near her, and also to choose a cheap airline. Emily was able to quickly rule out many different airlines, but now she is stuck between 2 different airlines. For some reason both of these airlines state the price of a ticket by how many bags that you have. Emily is carrying 4 bags. Each Airline also provides free meals for everyone on board. Airline 1 charges $250 for the ticket, plus $5.63 for each bagt that you have. Airline 2 charges $235.50 for the ticket, plus $6 per bag. Which airline should Emily choose? Write an algebraic expression for both airlines to find the price. </p>
