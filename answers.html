  <p class="text">Question 1</p>
  <br>
  <p class="questions">George is at the store. His kids wants cookies. George is on a tight budget, and wants to buy the cheapest cookies that he knows are good. While he was searching, he found 3 different types of cookies that his kids like, all selling for different prices. He wants to buy 10 cookies for his kids. The first cookies were selling for $5 per 2 cookies. The second cookies were selling for $0.30 per cookie. The 3rd cookies were selling for $0.25 per cookie, plus an extra $2.50 for a box to carry them in. Which cookies should Goarge get? Make an algebraic expression to find out. </p>
  <br>
  <p class="questions">Answer: The second cookies are the best deal for George. The first cookies are 5c. c = 10/2, c = 5. 5 * 5 = $25. The second cookies is 0.3c. c = 10, 0.3 * 10 = $3. The third cookies are 0.25c + 2.5. c = 10, 0.25 * 10 = 2.5. 2.5 + 2.5 = $5. $3<$5<$25, therefore the second cookies are the best deal. </p>

  <p class="questions">Emily doesn't have that much money to spend on things that aren't necessities. She lives in a country that doesn't do the greatest financially, and she works at a job that has very little pay, as it was the only job that she could get. Recently, after years of saving up, she finally has enough money to go on a much needed vacation. Emily really does need ths vacation, as she works very hard. Althogh she does have enough money for a full featured vacation, she doesn't want to blow all her hard earned money away. Due to this, she chose to go to a place that is near her, and also to choose a cheap airline. Emily was able to quickly rule out many different airlines, but now she is stuck between 2 different airlines. For some reason both of these airlines state the price of a ticket by how many bags that you have. Emily is carrying 4 bags. Each Airline also provides free meals for everyone on board. Airline 1 charges $250 for the ticket, plus $5.63 for each bagt that you have. Airline 2 charges $235.50 for the ticket, plus $6 per bag. Which airline should Emily choose? Write an algebraic expression for both airlines to find the price. </p>
  <br>
  <p class="questions">Answer: Airline 2 is a better choice for Emily. Airline 1 is 5.63b + 250. b = 4, 5.63 * 4 = $22.52. 22.52 + 250 = $272.52. Airline 2 is 6b + 235.5. b = 4, 6 * b = 24. 24 + 235.5 = $259.50. $259.50 < $272.52, therefore Airine 2 is a better choice.
